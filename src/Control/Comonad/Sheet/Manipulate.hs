Module      :  Control.Comonad.Sheet.Manipulate
Description :  Generic functions for manipulating multi-dimensional comonadic spreadsheets.
Copyright   :  Copyright (c) 2014 Kenneth Foner

Maintainer  :  kenneth.foner@gmail.com
Stability   :  experimental
Portability :  non-portable

This module defines the 'take', 'view', 'go', and 'insert' functions generically for any dimensionality of sheet. These
constitute the preferred way of manipulating sheets, providing an interface to: take finite slices ('take'), infinite
slices ('view'), move to locations ('go'), and insert finite or infinite structures ('insert').
